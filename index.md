## BTC Lab Blog

Hi 

I've started learning Rust and tooling related to the Bitcoin ecosystem have decided to document the learning process.

The goal of this blog is that it should contain tips and tricks learnt when developing tooling for various areas related 
to Bitcoin that might help others.

The first project is a simple Bitcoin CLI wallet using [BDK library](https://bitcoindevkit.org/) written in Rust.

But in the future I will also study creating Taproot transactions and hope to do a multi-signature wallet using
taproot as a base. After that I hope creating a simple Lightning wallet using the LDK library.

### About Me

I'm a software developer that have worked 20 years with Open Source development in PKI and cryptographic related applications, 
mainly in Java and Groovy.

I also maintain a Java project LightningJ (www.lightningj.org) a small project which provides a 
Java API for the LND RPC Endpoints that I have maintained since 2018.
